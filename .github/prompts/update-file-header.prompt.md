Apply the following edit to the file {{file}}:

Replace the content under the "Description of Changes" header (or add this header if it doesn't exist) with a concise summary of the current staged changes for this file.
Ensure the existing header is "Description of Changes:". If it's not present, add it at the top of the file after any existing license or copyright headers, or on the first line if no such headers exist.
